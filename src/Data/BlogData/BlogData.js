      "Nike has over 33 million followers on its primary Facebook page, gaining over 2 million new fans in 2017 alone! The brand published 62 posts in the time period and promoted more than 60% of them. In terms of content, Nike posted 43 videos and 15 photos. Videos were also the top-performing content for the brand. It is noteworthy that Nike has been focusing its Facebook strategy on videos even prior to the algorithm change in 2016.Nike’s social media strategy is a force to be reckoned with. Nike’s approach to social media is evolving—it now focuses more on ads than public content on Facebook. The brand has invested more in dark posts than public content in the last couple of years. It is also interesting to note that Nike has deleted a lot of its posts and videos on Facebook and YouTube from 2017-18.Posts and videos on Nike’s controversial campaigns like the 2019 “Dream Crazy” campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick and the 2017 product launch campaign of Nike’s first-ever hijab sportswear called “Pro Hijab” were some of the many posts that Nike had removed from their social media accounts. Nevertheless, Nike’s Instagram presence has always been active with a ton of engaging content, so it comes as no surprise that Nike is one of the most followed brands on Instagram.Nikes most engaging posts were part of two major campaigns they ran in 2017. Their ambitious “Breaking2” project brought a huge amount of social media attention for the brand. World-class marathon runners Eliud Kipchoge, Lelisa Desisa, and Zersenay Tadese attempted to run 26.219 miles in under two hours, a feat that has never been done before in the history of the sport. Regardless of the outcome, the ultimate winner was Nike as the athletes wore a customized version of Nike’s racing shoe for the event.Nike’s most engaging posts were part of two major campaigns they ran in 2017.

      "It’s 1985, and Gerald Deas A.K.A. “Dr. Deas,” a medical doctor, poet, playwright, and musician wrote a poem entitled “Felon Sneakers” warning against the perilous dangers of young men getting too enamored with sneaker culture. “If an unlucky brother winds up in jail,” warns Deas, “his felon sneakers can't get him bail.” Rather than serving as the cautionary tale that cajoled young men across America into loafers, the poem sparked a passionate response from one of the most explosive rap groups of the late ’80s. The following year Run-D.M.C’s stone-cold classic, “My Adidas”—would go on to turn the German sportswear brand into an intrinsic part of hip-hop culture. And so, an adidas flag was planted in the rap world.It was all a long way from adidas’ origins—the running shoe that first bore the name in 1949 (always lowercase) and the dreistreifen, a simple aesthetic touch of three parallel lines that would prove to be a masterstroke. Way before people were rocking gold rope and shell-toes with no laces, the product of German visionary Adolf “Adi” Dassler—he who hacked off and smashed together his name to create the brand we all know and love today—had a reputation for class, craft, and sporting excellence. Athletes everywhere knew where they stood once they got their hands on a pair of adidas kicks.The Superstar itself started off as a low-profile basketball shoe in 1969 and was soon brought to national attention by legendary NBA center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Bringing comfort and stability to basketball players who’d been use to the unforgiving structures and no-give soles of previous shoes was a huge step in the right direction. Within a few months three quarters of the NBA were in the shoes, and over the coming years the sneaker would leave the hardwood and hit the sidewalk, eventually gaining the attention of Joseph Simmons, Darryl McDaniels, and Jason William Mizell. Today we know the members of Hollis, Queens’ favorite rap group as Rev Run, D.M.C. and the late Jam Master Jay. Deciding to dress for the stage the same way they dressed for the streets, Run-D.M.C.’s adoption of the shoe and subsequent counter-punch against Deas’ anti-sneaker ode earned them a sponsorship deal from adidas to the tune of a cool $1 million.

      "We continue to invest in our relationships with partners such as the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, the Fair Labor Association (FLA), the Better Work Programme and the Social Labor Convergence Program. These organizations are integral to developing management capabilities within supplier facilities, measuring social performance and investing in working conditions across the industry. Additionally, we work with these organizations on joint standards, tools, programs and advocacy.Some affiliations take place at a country level. For example, in Indonesia, Nike was an original signatory of the 2011 Freedom of Association Protocol in Indonesia, which was signed by unions, suppliers, and leading brands manufacturing in the country. The Protocol provides an implementation framework for suppliers to support union activities to fully respect the rights of workers to join unions of their choosing and to bargain collectively. We meet regularly with the National Committee to review progress and discuss further opportunities for improvement.We are also working on addressing risks deeper in the supply chain, with a focus on advancing industry approaches and collaborative tools through existing associations. Nike is working with partners such as the FLA and the Better Cotton Initiative, which are seeking to address critical human rights risks. For example, we joined a project facilitated by the FLA in conjunction with İyi Pamuk Uygulamalari Derneği (IPUD), as well as several other international brands on improving employment practices in the Turkish cotton sector. The project focuses on preventing and addressing child labor and improving labor recruitment practices for migrant workers at the farm level.Beyond our own standards and programs, Nike advocates publicly for strengthening local laws protecting the rights of workers. In 2017 we joined the FLA, other brands and retailers to advocate for legislative reforms regarding freedom of association and collective bargaining in Mexico. We joined 20 other apparel and footwear brands and organizations in a letter to the Turkish Government to adjust the work permit program to improve conditions for Syrian refugees seeking work in Turkey. We also advocate for the inclusion of labor and environmental provisions when free trade agreements are negotiated.",

      "Reports of the death of sneakers have been greatly exaggerated. Sneaker sales are said to be down this year, and yet everywhere you look, everyone’s wearing Adidas Sambas. The humble soccer shoes enjoyed a sort of It-status in the ’90s, and have recently staged a comeback on the feet of our most stylish mononymous celebs (Hailey, Gigi, Bella, Kaia, EmRata). But thats not the whole story.In fact, summer 2023 belongs to a slew of very hard-to-get sneaker collaborations between independent female designers and sportswear giants. The British designer Grace Wales Bonner released her first collaboration with Adidas in fall 2020, and each subsequent release has only risen in popularity—in fact, I think she’s at least partly responsible for the Samba renaissance, a style shes been remixing since that first collaboration.Buying limited edition collabos requires a que será, será attitude; you make a note on your calendar, you prepare to log on to a website at a determined time, but whether or not that results in a purchase is completely up to a higher power. Interestingly, the Wales Bonner Adidas collections had not been completely impossible to purchase until the arrival, in June, of the spring 2023 metallic silver Sambas with beige crochet embroidery, which the whole world was seemingly waiting for. Friends set alarms to wake up at 4am—their sale time was appropriately UK-based—but it somehow proved not early enough. It was like the sneakers came into the world already sold-out.The silver Wales Bonner Adidas became not only the shoes of the summer, but status symbols: a sign that the wearer has taste, sure, but also access. Access to someone that can facilitate a purchase, or to really incredible online technology that can beat the bots at the time of purchase. (Other styles from the collection are indeed still available for purchase, but, of course, everyone just wants the silver.)",

      "he shoes that NBA players wear on the court has its own history. If you go back into the '70s and the early '80s, kind of the outlaw days of the NBA and the ABA, you had guys wearing a lot of wild stuff. Sometimes it seems like things now are crazier than they've ever been. But if you go back to the '70s and '80s, you will find Boston Celtics wearing green suede shoes, or things completely different from anyone else. I think, obviously, these pre dress code days, maybe there wasn't too much concern about what guys wore. Then you get into the '80s, and the now famous Michael Jordan brand show, the black and red shoe while his team was primarily wearing white, they needed everyone to sort of be similar so they weren't going to let him wear that shoe.That obviously turned into a moment for Nike. That turned into an entire marketing campaign, and those $5,000 fines the NBA levied were nothing compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue they made selling that shoe. It kind of moved into a stage where you would have guys wearing player editions. I know us at Slam would look at that and go look at photos of the NBA. You'd also look at what they were wearing. There would be things that were not available at retail and whether it was just embroidery or different colors than you could find in the store, it was still something different and something else to highlight. I don't know when this would have changed - probably in the 2000s. The NBA encored sneaker has kind of become self-aware, if you want to say it that way. Guys already knew that what they were wearing, was going to get noticed. I think if you look back in the '80s, someone like a Tiny Archibald wearing a green suede pair of Blazers, I mean he knows he's fly but, I don't think he knows that people are really going to be pointing out his shoes. Now you have it where before a shoe even makes it on a blog, you have a player themselves maybe taking a picture of their shoes on their way to the game or in their locker saying, Look out for this.They can get away with it. I mean, you look at someone like Michael Jordan who wore a new pair every night, but it was a new pair of the same couple of colors. He wasn't wearing like anything made for him specifically super crazy.",

      "ike has released sneakers to promote mental health awareness — and the shoes were so popular they sold out within 48 hours of launching online.The In My Feels Air Max 270s combined fashion with awareness by making subtle references to mental illness throughout the design, including re-designing the Nike swoosh symbol on the shoe. Instead of doing the standard swoosh, it was modified to show a squiggly line in reference to the ups and downs people experience in life.On the heels of the shoes, consumers will find the phrase 'In My Feels' in black text with the message flowing from one heel to the next. Then Have A NYC Nice Day is inscribed in black text on the tongue of the sneakers. The brand partnered with mental health advocate Liz Beecroft to create the new shoes, and the woman detailed in an Instagram post what it meant to involved in the creation of the product.  'Creating these sneakers was a way for me to combine both of my passions into one and to be able to raise awareness and advocate for mental health within the sneaker community,' she wrote.",

      "The Nike-owned brand has expanded even further in recent years, entering into football apparel in 2018 in the form of a three-year deal with French club Paris Saint-Germain to produce training, high-performance and lifestyle attire for the Ligue 1 champions. The attire includes the Jordan Brand  featuring on the PSG kits during UEFA Champions League games, as well as bespoke PSG Air Jordan sneakers. This collaboration has proven successful, with US sales of PSG jerseys increasing 470% a year after the agreement . PSG generated 60million euros in sales from the partnership in 2019. These events have led to the deal between the two parties being extended till 2022.Air Jordan is now a $10 billion brand, earning revenue of $3.1 billion as of the 2019 fiscal year. With its expanding global influence, the Jumpman may soon be commonplace in every sport and in every household. Considering the cultural influence of MJ and his eponymous brand, it’s crazy to read that Jordan contemplated skipping that Nike meeting in 1984.Nike expected sales to hit $3 million by the fourth year of Jordan’s contract, sales totalled about $30 million in test markets alone after a month. After the first year of its release, Air Jordan had brought in revenue of $126 million. Nike had only brought in $65 million in total revenue the year before.Sales clearly exceeded expectations. The Air Jordan 1s appealed to demographics that weren’t accounted for. Nike had intended the market to be African American teens but in the hype, the Jordans became desired by people of all ages, race and class. The sneakers were light on the feet, flexible and fashionable. Jordan winning NBA rookie of the year in 1985 certainly didn’t hurt brand popularity either. ",

      "Vans has just presented its “This is Off The Wall” campaign for 2023, enlisting a lineup of new ambassadors to front a series of styles that represent the individuality and self-expression each ambassador stands for.The new Vans ambassadors for the campaign come in the form of UK rap star Little Simz, along with Beatrice Domond, Felipe Nunes, Irene Kim, Cocona Hiraka, Arthur Bray, and Salome Agbaroji. Each of the chosen stars has excelled in the worlds of music and sport in recent times, while also representing a collection of communities within the fringes of the societies they grew up in.As a whole, the new campaign from Vans looks to capture the empowerment that is felt within this new generation of creatives as they embark on their journey of self-discovery. Supported by bold color schemes and distorted visuals, the looks present unique takes on Vans’ latest era of footwear design.In line with the “This is Off The Wall” campaign, a new Vans Knu Skool silhouette has been presented. Standing as a revitalized version of the classic Old Skool design, the new sneaker has been made for today, with modern adjustments being made to the ’90s low-top. For example, the sneaker has been reworked with a puffed-up tongue and ankle collar, while sturdy suede uppers have been applied to the signature rubber waffle outsoles and diamond Sidestrip. Additionally, the chunky sneaker also features newly-introduced heel-pulls that offer easy-in-easy-out access.Speaking about the new campaign, British musician and actress, Little Simz said: “Style to me is your source, your taste, your identity. When I think of my style, fashion, and music, I believe it makes me who I am. Simz the person, Simz the artist. It’s very reflective of my character and what I’m into. To be honest, I dont really think its what you do, its how you do it.You can check out the new campaign from Vans above and the latest Knu Skool sneaker is available to shop via the official Vans website.In other news, check out the new Original Shift x Dr. Martens link-up.",
