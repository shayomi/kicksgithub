      "ike has released sneakers to promote mental health awareness — and the shoes were so popular they sold out within 48 hours of launching online.The In My Feels Air Max 270s combined fashion with awareness by making subtle references to mental illness throughout the design, including re-designing the Nike swoosh symbol on the shoe. Instead of doing the standard swoosh, it was modified to show a squiggly line in reference to the ups and downs people experience in life.On the heels of the shoes, consumers will find the phrase 'In My Feels' in black text with the message flowing from one heel to the next. Then Have A NYC Nice Day is inscribed in black text on the tongue of the sneakers. The brand partnered with mental health advocate Liz Beecroft to create the new shoes, and the woman detailed in an Instagram post what it meant to involved in the creation of the product.  'Creating these sneakers was a way for me to combine both of my passions into one and to be able to raise awareness and advocate for mental health within the sneaker community,' she wrote.",

      "The Nike-owned brand has expanded even further in recent years, entering into football apparel in 2018 in the form of a three-year deal with French club Paris Saint-Germain to produce training, high-performance and lifestyle attire for the Ligue 1 champions. The attire includes the Jordan Brand  featuring on the PSG kits during UEFA Champions League games, as well as bespoke PSG Air Jordan sneakers. This collaboration has proven successful, with US sales of PSG jerseys increasing 470% a year after the agreement . PSG generated 60million euros in sales from the partnership in 2019. These events have led to the deal between the two parties being extended till 2022.Air Jordan is now a $10 billion brand, earning revenue of $3.1 billion as of the 2019 fiscal year. With its expanding global influence, the Jumpman may soon be commonplace in every sport and in every household. Considering the cultural influence of MJ and his eponymous brand, it’s crazy to read that Jordan contemplated skipping that Nike meeting in 1984.Nike expected sales to hit $3 million by the fourth year of Jordan’s contract, sales totalled about $30 million in test markets alone after a month. After the first year of its release, Air Jordan had brought in revenue of $126 million. Nike had only brought in $65 million in total revenue the year before.Sales clearly exceeded expectations. The Air Jordan 1s appealed to demographics that weren’t accounted for. Nike had intended the market to be African American teens but in the hype, the Jordans became desired by people of all ages, race and class. The sneakers were light on the feet, flexible and fashionable. Jordan winning NBA rookie of the year in 1985 certainly didn’t hurt brand popularity either. ",
