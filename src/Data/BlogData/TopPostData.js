      "Nike has over 33 million followers on its primary Facebook page, gaining over 2 million new fans in 2017 alone! The brand published 62 posts in the time period and promoted more than 60% of them. In terms of content, Nike posted 43 videos and 15 photos. Videos were also the top-performing content for the brand. It is noteworthy that Nike has been focusing its Facebook strategy on videos even prior to the algorithm change in 2016.Nike’s social media strategy is a force to be reckoned with. Nike’s approach to social media is evolving—it now focuses more on ads than public content on Facebook. The brand has invested more in dark posts than public content in the last couple of years. It is also interesting to note that Nike has deleted a lot of its posts and videos on Facebook and YouTube from 2017-18.Posts and videos on Nike’s controversial campaigns like the 2019 “Dream Crazy” campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick and the 2017 product launch campaign of Nike’s first-ever hijab sportswear called “Pro Hijab” were some of the many posts that Nike had removed from their social media accounts. Nevertheless, Nike’s Instagram presence has always been active with a ton of engaging content, so it comes as no surprise that Nike is one of the most followed brands on Instagram.Nikes most engaging posts were part of two major campaigns they ran in 2017. Their ambitious “Breaking2” project brought a huge amount of social media attention for the brand. World-class marathon runners Eliud Kipchoge, Lelisa Desisa, and Zersenay Tadese attempted to run 26.219 miles in under two hours, a feat that has never been done before in the history of the sport. Regardless of the outcome, the ultimate winner was Nike as the athletes wore a customized version of Nike’s racing shoe for the event.Nike’s most engaging posts were part of two major campaigns they ran in 2017.

      "It’s 1985, and Gerald Deas A.K.A. “Dr. Deas,” a medical doctor, poet, playwright, and musician wrote a poem entitled “Felon Sneakers” warning against the perilous dangers of young men getting too enamored with sneaker culture. “If an unlucky brother winds up in jail,” warns Deas, “his felon sneakers can't get him bail.” Rather than serving as the cautionary tale that cajoled young men across America into loafers, the poem sparked a passionate response from one of the most explosive rap groups of the late ’80s. The following year Run-D.M.C’s stone-cold classic, “My Adidas”—would go on to turn the German sportswear brand into an intrinsic part of hip-hop culture. And so, an adidas flag was planted in the rap world.It was all a long way from adidas’ origins—the running shoe that first bore the name in 1949 (always lowercase) and the dreistreifen, a simple aesthetic touch of three parallel lines that would prove to be a masterstroke. Way before people were rocking gold rope and shell-toes with no laces, the product of German visionary Adolf “Adi” Dassler—he who hacked off and smashed together his name to create the brand we all know and love today—had a reputation for class, craft, and sporting excellence. Athletes everywhere knew where they stood once they got their hands on a pair of adidas kicks.The Superstar itself started off as a low-profile basketball shoe in 1969 and was soon brought to national attention by legendary NBA center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Bringing comfort and stability to basketball players who’d been use to the unforgiving structures and no-give soles of previous shoes was a huge step in the right direction. Within a few months three quarters of the NBA were in the shoes, and over the coming years the sneaker would leave the hardwood and hit the sidewalk, eventually gaining the attention of Joseph Simmons, Darryl McDaniels, and Jason William Mizell. Today we know the members of Hollis, Queens’ favorite rap group as Rev Run, D.M.C. and the late Jam Master Jay. Deciding to dress for the stage the same way they dressed for the streets, Run-D.M.C.’s adoption of the shoe and subsequent counter-punch against Deas’ anti-sneaker ode earned them a sponsorship deal from adidas to the tune of a cool $1 million.

      "We continue to invest in our relationships with partners such as the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, the Fair Labor Association (FLA), the Better Work Programme and the Social Labor Convergence Program. These organizations are integral to developing management capabilities within supplier facilities, measuring social performance and investing in working conditions across the industry. Additionally, we work with these organizations on joint standards, tools, programs and advocacy.Some affiliations take place at a country level. For example, in Indonesia, Nike was an original signatory of the 2011 Freedom of Association Protocol in Indonesia, which was signed by unions, suppliers, and leading brands manufacturing in the country. The Protocol provides an implementation framework for suppliers to support union activities to fully respect the rights of workers to join unions of their choosing and to bargain collectively. We meet regularly with the National Committee to review progress and discuss further opportunities for improvement.We are also working on addressing risks deeper in the supply chain, with a focus on advancing industry approaches and collaborative tools through existing associations. Nike is working with partners such as the FLA and the Better Cotton Initiative, which are seeking to address critical human rights risks. For example, we joined a project facilitated by the FLA in conjunction with İyi Pamuk Uygulamalari Derneği (IPUD), as well as several other international brands on improving employment practices in the Turkish cotton sector. The project focuses on preventing and addressing child labor and improving labor recruitment practices for migrant workers at the farm level.Beyond our own standards and programs, Nike advocates publicly for strengthening local laws protecting the rights of workers. In 2017 we joined the FLA, other brands and retailers to advocate for legislative reforms regarding freedom of association and collective bargaining in Mexico. We joined 20 other apparel and footwear brands and organizations in a letter to the Turkish Government to adjust the work permit program to improve conditions for Syrian refugees seeking work in Turkey. We also advocate for the inclusion of labor and environmental provisions when free trade agreements are negotiated.",
