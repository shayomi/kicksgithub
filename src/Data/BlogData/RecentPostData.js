      "Reports of the death of sneakers have been greatly exaggerated. Sneaker sales are said to be down this year, and yet everywhere you look, everyone’s wearing Adidas Sambas. The humble soccer shoes enjoyed a sort of It-status in the ’90s, and have recently staged a comeback on the feet of our most stylish mononymous celebs (Hailey, Gigi, Bella, Kaia, EmRata). But thats not the whole story.In fact, summer 2023 belongs to a slew of very hard-to-get sneaker collaborations between independent female designers and sportswear giants. The British designer Grace Wales Bonner released her first collaboration with Adidas in fall 2020, and each subsequent release has only risen in popularity—in fact, I think she’s at least partly responsible for the Samba renaissance, a style shes been remixing since that first collaboration.Buying limited edition collabos requires a que será, será attitude; you make a note on your calendar, you prepare to log on to a website at a determined time, but whether or not that results in a purchase is completely up to a higher power. Interestingly, the Wales Bonner Adidas collections had not been completely impossible to purchase until the arrival, in June, of the spring 2023 metallic silver Sambas with beige crochet embroidery, which the whole world was seemingly waiting for. Friends set alarms to wake up at 4am—their sale time was appropriately UK-based—but it somehow proved not early enough. It was like the sneakers came into the world already sold-out.The silver Wales Bonner Adidas became not only the shoes of the summer, but status symbols: a sign that the wearer has taste, sure, but also access. Access to someone that can facilitate a purchase, or to really incredible online technology that can beat the bots at the time of purchase. (Other styles from the collection are indeed still available for purchase, but, of course, everyone just wants the silver.)",

      "he shoes that NBA players wear on the court has its own history. If you go back into the '70s and the early '80s, kind of the outlaw days of the NBA and the ABA, you had guys wearing a lot of wild stuff. Sometimes it seems like things now are crazier than they've ever been. But if you go back to the '70s and '80s, you will find Boston Celtics wearing green suede shoes, or things completely different from anyone else. I think, obviously, these pre dress code days, maybe there wasn't too much concern about what guys wore. Then you get into the '80s, and the now famous Michael Jordan brand show, the black and red shoe while his team was primarily wearing white, they needed everyone to sort of be similar so they weren't going to let him wear that shoe.That obviously turned into a moment for Nike. That turned into an entire marketing campaign, and those $5,000 fines the NBA levied were nothing compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue they made selling that shoe. It kind of moved into a stage where you would have guys wearing player editions. I know us at Slam would look at that and go look at photos of the NBA. You'd also look at what they were wearing. There would be things that were not available at retail and whether it was just embroidery or different colors than you could find in the store, it was still something different and something else to highlight. I don't know when this would have changed - probably in the 2000s. The NBA encored sneaker has kind of become self-aware, if you want to say it that way. Guys already knew that what they were wearing, was going to get noticed. I think if you look back in the '80s, someone like a Tiny Archibald wearing a green suede pair of Blazers, I mean he knows he's fly but, I don't think he knows that people are really going to be pointing out his shoes. Now you have it where before a shoe even makes it on a blog, you have a player themselves maybe taking a picture of their shoes on their way to the game or in their locker saying, Look out for this.They can get away with it. I mean, you look at someone like Michael Jordan who wore a new pair every night, but it was a new pair of the same couple of colors. He wasn't wearing like anything made for him specifically super crazy.",
